Description:

At its core, Meteor Fall is a simple two-dimensional game in which the user is kept on their toes by avoiding falling meteors. It's purpose is to supply the user with an easy to grasp, fun game that challenges the user with difficult and addictive gameplay; this in turn encourages the user to keep beating high scores and unlocking rewards.

This was a term project for the "Non-Traditional Platform Computing" course at UPEI. This project was completed as a team, I worked alongside my peers Brandon Banks and Corey Weber to develop it. The app is written completely using the Objective-C language. The app received a perfect mark of 100%. All graphics, images, and media are original work.

This is an ongoing project of ours, and we have plans of releasing it on the app store once we sort out some bugs with the newest iOS 8 mobile operating system. This app was develloped, deployed, tested, and deemed 100% functional on the iOS 7 platform as was required by the course.
